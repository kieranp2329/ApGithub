> Learn Anything In Four Steps With The Feynman Technique

This skips over a lot of work between 1 and 2... but I love how teaching it, or pretending to, gets you 

1. Pick a topic you want to understand and start studying it. **Write down everything you know about the topic on a notebook page**, and add to that page every time you learn something new about it.

2. Pretend to **teach your topic to a classroom.** Make sure you're able to explain the topic in simple terms.

3. Go back to the books when you get stuck. The gaps in your knowledge should be obvious. **Revisit problem areas until you can explain the topic fully.**

4. Simplify and use analogies. **Repeat the process while simplifying your language** and connecting facts with analogies to help strengthen your understanding.
